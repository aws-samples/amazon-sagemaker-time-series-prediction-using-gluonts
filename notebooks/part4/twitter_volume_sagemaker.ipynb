    "In [part3](../part3/twitter_volume_forecast.ipynb) we have trained a DeepAR model. Apart from prediction_length, time freqency and number of epochs we did not specify any other hyperparameters. DeepAR has many hyperparameters and in this section we will use SageMaker automatic model tuner to find the right set for our model. Here is a short list of some hyperparameters and their default values in GluonTS DeepAR:\n",
